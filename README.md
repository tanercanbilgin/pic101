## Introduction
In this repository, I've documented my progress as I delved into the fascinating realm of microcontrollers, particularly focusing on PIC16F877 after initially starting with Arduino. Each project represents a milestone in my learning journey, providing insights into various aspects of embedded systems development.

## Contents
1. **ALU**: Explore examples related to Arithmetic Logic Unit.
2. **RAM**: Building different Random Access Memories.
3. **First Code (Blink)**: Get started with the classic Blink code example.
4. **Ports**: Learn about handling ports in microcontrollers.
5. **7Seg Display**: Dive into projects related to 7-Segment Displays.
6. **Interrupts and External Interrupts**: Explore the usage of interrupts and external interrupts.
7. **Timer Interrupts**: Understand how to work with timer interrupts.
8. **Capture Compare and PWM**: Discover projects related to Capture, Compare and Pulse Width Modulation.
9. **Keypad and LCD**: Learn about interfacing keypad and LCD displays with microcontrollers.

## About
